----- TRG server -----
This server runs the TRG websites providing endpoints for the html pages and the api calls.

----- To Run -----
./TRGserver.py

----- Notes -----
For the formulas in our database, we defined our own syntax for adding condition statements.
Formulas can only contain one conditional per formula, so boolean logic must used if more are needed.
Eval() evaluates python syntax, so in most cases all other syntax in the formulas can be used as such. 
However, We had to require certain python3 key words to be substituted to avoid conflicts with variable names.
The statements before and after the colon must have a statement even if it is just True.

Syntax: CONDITION? IF TRUE: IF FALSE

Substitutions:
not -> !
and -> &
if complete -> C
if regular -> R
vertex connectivity -> k
for edge connectivity -> l
minimum degree -> d
maximum degree -> D
